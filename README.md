Backend Service - Firebase
	We decided to use one of the tools the professor mentioned called Firebase. 
	Firebase handles both our user management and persistence of our data, mainly
	a users stack of gold/silver/platinum. We implemented the user management part
	by following a tutorial on firebase and using oauth to authenticate a user. 
	Mainly, we had to setup a new application on facebook and google to create an 
	APP ID and SECRET ACCESS KEY so that any user who wishes to register with our 
	application using facebook or google can do so. The CRUD operations were handles
	using Firebase's API methods, mainly push and update.

Database Management

We used firebase to manage the data.... This required facebook and email login intergration. users can add, edit, and delete items....

CRUD

We used input forms and javascript to save the needed variables to our firebase database.

Quandl

We used Quandl to get realtime data for the current prices of gold, silver, and platinium.
Data for the graphs was taken from the Quandl databases for Gold American Eagle, Silver Engelhard 
industrial bullion, and Platinum Engelhard fabricated products. The prices of the past 30 days
are displayed from these sources.
