Database Management

We used firebase to manage the data.... This required facebook and email login intergration. users can add, edit, and delete items....

CRUD

We used input forms and javascript to save the needed variables to our firebase database.

Quandl

We used Quandl to get realtime data for the current prices of gold, silver, and platinium.
Data for the graphs was taken from the Quandl databases for Gold American Eagle, Silver Engelhard 
industrial bullion, and Platinum Engelhard fabricated products. The prices of the past 30 days
are displayed from these sources.
